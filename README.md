# Rocket_Elevators_Controllers
Contains the algorithm files for the elevator controllers for the New Rocket Elevator Solutions for both Residential and Commercial Offers.

The Residential controller algorithms are written in Javascript and Python.
In order to use the files, for Javascript, it is best to run it either on the web browser or on repl.it since some commands do not work on the terminal.
The goal of the programs are to find out which elevators would arrive first when the call button is pressed. It also involves other elements such as the movement of the elevator,
the opening and the closing of the doors, and other components that an elevator need to run smoothly.

The Residential Building contains 2 elevators and 10 floors. In order to test the movement of the elevator, on:

2. If you wish to change the direction and the floor of the call button. Find #STEP 2: REQUEST ELEVATOR and change the values inside the paranthesis.
3. Copy the whole code onto repl.it and run it.

Python
